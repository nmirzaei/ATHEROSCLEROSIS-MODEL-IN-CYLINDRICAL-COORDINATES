# ATHEROSCLEROSIS-MODEL-IN-CYLINDRICAL-COORDINATES

These codes investigate the effect of growth in single directions as well as anisotropic and isotropic case. 
The domain is a symmetric cylinder
All the Mesh files have the same geometry but possibly different meshing (to get better convergence in different cases).
Lustre, Home, Local drives correspond to scrath and home memory and personal computer memory locations respectively.
